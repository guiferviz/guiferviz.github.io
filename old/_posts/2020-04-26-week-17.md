Irish time!

# Anki Flashcards generator

Mnemocards 0.1.3 is out!
This version of Mnemocards is the first one to be public available for
everyone.
Last version were already public but not well documented.
That's what I did during a couple of days of this week, adding documentation
and improving some important details of the code.

I want to keep a constant public API so people do not need to change their
`cards_config.json` files every time a new version is out.
I did some little changes in the structure of the configuration file and I
think now it's ready to be public for everyone.

Also, I invest a lot of time trying to publish the package on PyPi.
This error makes me invest 3 times more time as I was expecting:

    ERROR: Packages installed from PyPI cannot depend on packages which are not also hosted on PyPI.
    mnemocards depends on genanki@ git+https://github.com/guiferviz/genanki.git@feature-deck-conf

Some weeks ago I made a fork of Genanki to add new features (deck
configurations) and those changes are still not merged into the package.
I don't think they will ever be merged, because the pull request didn't get
very good reception (no comments, no likes... I'm very sad about it).
So I need to rely on my fork as a dependency to Mnemocards.
**How did I solved this problem?**

There isn't any good solution to this, so I choose to change my installing
instructions.
Instead of installing with `pip install mnemocards` your should install the
package in two steps:
```
pip install --no-deps mnemocards
pip install mnemocards
```

For some reason, installing the package first and install the dependencies
later seems to work fine.
It also works when installing it from source with `python setup.py install`.

The dependency in the `requirements.txt` file looks like this:

    genanki @ git+https://github.com/guiferviz/genanki.git@feature-deck-conf

Another [alternatives for solving this problem][pythonDiscuss] are:

 * Publish my own version of Genanki to PyPi and use that as a reference.
 * Add the fork as a git submodule and include the code in my project as a
 vendor library.
 * Host your own PyPi server and use `--extend-index-url` to install your
 own version of the packages.

I think that my solution does not work when you add Mnemocards in any other
`requirements.txt`, just because you cannot specify there install without
dependencies and later install dependencies.
Anyway, for installing applications that are not supposed to be used as a
dependency for other packages it seems a good workaround.
Hope this helps someone.

This is the [Mnemocards repository on GitHub][repo].
Try it out!


# Uranium

Not too much visible work in Uranium, apart from publishing the
[post 01 about compiling and installing LLVM, Clang, Flex and Bison][post01].

I've been reading the [dragon book][dragonBook] of compilers, chapter 3
about grammars.
Still reading it.


# Competitive programming - CodeForces

My favourite problem of the week is [problem D of competition 1343][problemD].
I used prefix sums to solve it in linear time.

{% highlight python %}
def solve():
    # Read input.
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))

    h = n // 2
    c = [0] * (2*k+2)
    for i in range(h):
        # Two changes
        c[0] += 2
        # No change in this pair.
        p = a[i] + a[n-i-1]
        c[p] += -1
        c[p+1] += 1
        # Only one change.
        min_sum_1 = min(a[i], a[n-i-1]) + 1
        max_sum_1 = max(a[i], a[n-i-1]) + k
        c[min_sum_1] += -1
        c[max_sum_1+1] += 1
    # Compute prefix sum.
    s = 0
    for i in range(len(c)):
        s += c[i]
        c[i] = s

    print(min(c))
{% endhighlight %}


# What about next week?

Continue with the Uranium series, maybe a new CodeForces programming
competition and pick up [AIdictive][aidictive], my old ML library to try to
launch a first version in two weeks.
